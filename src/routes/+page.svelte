<h1>ReVanced Web Manager</h1>
<p>
	ReVanced was born out of Vanced's discontinuation and it is our goal to continue the legacy of
	what Vanced left behind. Thanks to ReVanced Patcher, it's possible to create long-lasting patches
	for nearly any Android app. ReVanced's patching system is designed to allow patches to work on new
	versions of the apps automatically with bare minimum maintenance. ReVanced offers a variety of
	patches, including ad-blocking, custom themes, and innovative features. All of which is completely
	open source and free of charge.
